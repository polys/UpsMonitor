## UPS Monitor

A monitoring utility for my old [UPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply) that only had a COM port ([Dry Contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_contact) I/O) and was bundled with ‘software’ that only worked on Windows 95/98.

*An old project from back in 2011 that's no longer maintained.*
